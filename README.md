# Multichoice Template

This is a template for creating tasks (assessments) for the ROAR / LEVANTE projects that can be hosted on ROAD or run standalone (web app). It has boilerplate code and structure that simplifies a lot of the repeated work of creating a new task. 


## How to use this template
